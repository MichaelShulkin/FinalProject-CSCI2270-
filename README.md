/* For my final project, I will be creating a calendar. This calendar will be for the year of 2016 and can be used to schedule meetings and events at different times throughout each day. The calendar will be made using a hash table and will use linked lists to resolve collisions. The hash function will return a specific day in the year and the linked list will store items chronologically (i.e. if on May 17 there is a meeting scheduled at 11am to 12pm, a new meeting from 9am to 10 am will be inserted before the 11am meeting in the linked list).

Other features include:
-Ability to store date, time, short description, and place of meeting
-Some major holidays will be stored (read in through a text file in the constructor) and a message will occur if a meeting is being scheduled on a holiday
-Scheduling conflicts will be notified (and maybe an alternative time will be suggested?)

Suggestions are welcome for additional ideas!
